# Tailwind CSS 3.0 as a PostCSS Plugin

A starter template for very simple projects (no frameworks) with Tailwind CSS 3.0 setup as a PostCSS plugin.

## Getting Started

1.  Clone the repository

         git clone https://github.com/pnqphong95/tailwind-css-starter-postcss.git {{ your project name }}

2.  Download and install NPM - [A Beginnerâ€™s Guide to npm](https://www.sitepoint.com/npm-guide/)

3.  Install dependencies

        npm install

4.  Watch changes and build styles using Tailwind CSS

        npm run dev

5.  Open the `layouts > index.html` file in your browser and you should see a heading styled with a gradient. If you don't see a gradient on the text, something went wrong.

## How to use

- Go to `layouts > index.html` Remove the `<h1>` element and start adding your own HTML.
- If you need to add more HTML pages, add them in the `layouts` folder.
